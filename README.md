# RedirectTraffic

This depends on https://github.com/wrharper/WindivertWrapper and is the main event to make it possible to handle traffic.

The .Sys file is digitally signed thanks to https://github.com/basil00/WinDivert, but still be very careful.

If you don't know what you are doing, you can be stuck in a windows boot loop. Disable driver signature enforcement as a startup option if this happens to recover.

Program.cs should give enough examples to show how to use this properly.
